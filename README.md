This crate provides an FFI layer and idiomatic rust wrappers for the new [DirectXShaderCompiler](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler) library.

- [Documentation](https://docs.rs/hassle-rs)

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
hassle-rs = "0.5.4"
```

Then acquire `dxcompiler.dll` on Windows or `libdxcompiler.so` on Linux directly from [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/antiagainst/directxshadercompiler/branch/master/artifacts), or compile it from source according to the instructions in the [DirectXShaderCompiler](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler) GitHub repository and make sure it's in the executable environment.

DxcValidator also requires `dxil.dll` which can be grabbed from any recent Windows 10 SDK flight.

## Compile HLSL into SPIR-V:

```rust
let spirv = compile_hlsl(
    "shader_filename.hlsl",
    code,
    "copyCs",
    "cs_6_5",
    &vec!["-spirv"],
    &vec![
        ("MY_DEFINE", Some("Value")),
        ("OTHER_DEFINE", None)
    ],
);
```

## Compile HLSL into DXIL and validate it:

```rust
let dxil = compile_hlsl("test.cs.hlsl", test_cs, "main", "cs_6_5", args, &[]).unwrap();
let result = validate_dxil(&dxil); // Only a Windows machine in Developer Mode can run non-validated DXIL

if let Some(err) = result.err() {
    println!("validation failed: {}", err);
}
```

## macOS support

One can build `libdxcompiler.dynlib` from source with [this commit](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/pull/3062/commits/9f2b30aa333f22eed00bf37b3a9b94f5ff5d23fe) for `clang` or [the entire PR](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/pull/3062) for `GCC`, by following [the DXC Unix build guide](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/blob/master/docs/DxcOnUnix.rst#building-dxc). These patches [have been merged](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/commit/af14220b45d3ce46e0bad51ce79655e41d07c478) to DXC and are available since `release-1.6.2012`.

## Linux support

Linux shares the same requirements as [macOS support](#macOS-support) when compiling from source but DXC provides prebuilt libraries for every commit on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dnovillo/directxshadercompiler/history). These are linked from individual commits on GitHub too.

Furthermore semantics around `BSTR` (only used in `intellisense`) have [changed since hassle-rs 0.5.1](https://github.com/Traverse-Research/hassle-rs/commit/94670248cc01614c3a9c9f4d5288afb4040544bd) and require `libdxcompiler.so` compiled from at least [this commit](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/commit/2ade6f84d6b95bfd96eec1d6d15e3aa3b519d180), also included in `release-1.6.2012`. `Intellisense` on hassle-rs `0.5.0` and below is not compatible with these newer libraries.
